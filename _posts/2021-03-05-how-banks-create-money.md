A very common view on banking can be summarized by the following statement:

>Banks accept deposits from savers and then loan those deposits out to borrowers

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how banking really works. There's no law that says that deposits need to be at least equal to or greater than outstanding loans. In fact, banks can loan out much more money than they have in deposits. Which leads us to the following question, *where does this **extra** money come from?*  Is it just created from thin air? The short answer is yes! It's called **credit** and it's much much more widespread than you'd think. 

## What is credit?

Imagine you go shopping at your neighbourhood grocery store. But when you go up to the aisle to pay for your groceries you realize you've forgotten your wallet at home. Let's say your groceries cost $20. The clerk, knowing you're a trustworthy person, writes on a slip of paper that you owe him $20.However, you're off the hook till the next time you go to the grocery store. Poof! The clerk just created $20 dollars out of thin air. 

Let's explore why that is the case. You can now go home and spend a $20 dollar bill that would have been used for groceries however you'd like. But the clerk's slip of paper also functions as money in a sense and this is precisely the money that was created. Who would have thought grocery store clerks had the power to create money!

But how exactly does the slip of paper function as money? Let's take our example a little further. It just so happens that the store clerk is a big cookie aficionado and your grandma is the best baker in town. The clerk can now go to your grandma and buy cookies for $20 worth in exchange for the paper slip. You now owe your grandma the $20 dollars you owed the clerk. The *new* $20 worth of money created by this system doesn't exit the *money supply* (the total amount of money in the economy) until you pay up the debt and tear up the slip of paper. 

From this little toy example we can see that credit is inherently built on **trust**. The clerk would never have issued the paper slip if he didn't trust that at some point in the future you would pay for your groceries. And for the credit to be functionally equivalent to money it needs other people to trust it as well, not just your grandma. 

Now for the definition: The paper slip is what we call credit, which is simply an *agreement between two parties on a payment for certain resources at a later date*. Note that this simultaneously creates **debt**, the store clerk gets the credit but you have a debt to pay it back. 

Banks function in a very similar way as the clerk did in our example except they do it on a much larger scale and there's widespread trust in the credit they issue. In fact most of what we normally call money in the economy is indeed credit and a tiny minority is cash, i.e. physical coins and bills. 


## What's the difference between credit and money?

The difference between the terms such as credit, money and cash is blurry. In everyday life credit such as bank deposits is functionally equivalent to cash but there are important distinctions. 

It is helpful to think about bank deposits as being denominated in different currency that is pegged to a national currency such as the U.S. dollar one-to-one.[^banktrust] Let's say that you are a customer of Bank of America (BAC). This means that when you go to the ATM to withdraw cash what you're really saying is:


*I'm going to exchange x BAC dollars for x U.S. dollars*


And voilà, you've now converted BAC dollars from the chequing account stored on a computer server to physical slips of paper called U.S. dollars. This seems like a lot of mental gymnastics but bear with me.

Now, back to our question. *Is there a difference between the BAC dollar (credit) and a U.S. dollar?*


**Yes, there is!** When you went to the ATM to withdraw cash Bank of America had to scramble to find those U.S. dollars to give to you. Remember, credit is a promise for a payment in the future. When you originally deposited U.S. dollars into your chequing account credit was created with a promise to pay you back your original U.S. dollars in the future. The credit was the BAC dollar amount displayed in your bank account. Meanwhile Bank of America is free to use your physical U.S. dollar however it wants. It can buy assets such as a building for a new branch or the hottest new tech stock. It could also store the bills in a vault or put them in an ATM.

*But what happens if Bank of America doesn't have enough bills when the time comes for your ATM withdrawal?*


It must  sell some of its assets, like stocks, for U.S. dollars. This process is called **liquidation**. If the bank doesn't have enough assets or the assets turn out to be very *illiquid*, i.e. hard to convert to cash, the bank runs the risk of defaulting on its obligations to you and becoming *insolvent*. And you might not get all of the money you deposited back from the bankruptcy process. This is called *liquidity risk* and it's one of the reasons banks cannot create an infinite amount of loans. When a bank defaults it violates our one-to-one assumption of BAC dollars to U.S. dollars and we can finally see why they are not perfectly equivalent. 

Any time the bank is forced to convert its own currency to U.S. dollars it has to find those U.S. dollars somewhere. This can happen when people transfer money to a different bank, ATM withdrawals, anything that takes money out of the world of that bank. Keeping this much cash on hand is costly since it doesn't pay any interest[^centralbank] so banks invest in long term assets such as stocks and bonds. The bank doesn't want to be forced to sell those assets at an unfortunate time. In fact, massive selling could cause the value of those assets to plummet even further. This is why banks come up with ATM withdrawal limits, withdrawal fees, accounts with less flexibility to withdraw, like savings accounts, all to incentivize customers to refrain from forcing the bank to convert its made-up currency into the national one.  

Insolvencies used to happen very frequently in the past and they are a long way from being extinct. A recent example is the British bank *Northern Rock* in 2009. The bank defaulted during the financial crisis and a lot of people lost most of their deposits. When people sense a bank is at a risk of becoming insolvent they will rush to withdraw their deposits. This is frequently referred to as a **bank run**[^fdic]. The psychological herd mentality fuelling bank runs ironically increases the chances of the bank becoming insolvent. The bank might not be able to sell its assets for a good enough price all at once so the crowd's fear of insolvency becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

From this discussion we can see that are different tiers of credit. The tiers have different levels of trust. For example a Walmart gift card has more risk than a bank deposit which again has more risk than a U.S. dollar. In fact the U.S. dollar can be viewed as credit for goods and services in the economy. It is a promise that at a later date you can exchange it for a resource you need.[^theoryofmoney] And to force my own unwieldy definition of the word *money*:

> *Money* is a term that can be used for a set of credits that have a minimum level of trust that are used for transactions in the economy. 


## Summary 

Even though we treat our deposits like cash it is important to remember that they are not. We've learned that it is helpful to think of it as it's own currency that is pegged to whatever national currency the account is denominated in. The bank can issue as much of this currency as it wants when creating loans subject to some regulation. Sometimes the banks get a little too excited and issues too much, at that point the illusion is lifted. The deposit on the computer screen is not equal to physical cash. But we shouldn't be surprised as these credit bubbles behave in a lot of similar ways as stock bubbles (see my earlier blog [post]({% post_url 2021-01-28-the-psychology-of-stock-bubbles %})). The stock and credit markets are systems controlled by the whims of humans and are therefore bound by the laws of psychology. It follows that we shouldn't be surprised that they exhibit the same imperfections as human nature with all its heighs and lows.

[^banktrust]: In the past this was exactly how banks issued credit. They printed their own bank notes, e.g. a Bank of America bill. This had a lot of problems including the bank notes with the same face value being valued differently depending on the risk of a particular bank defaulting. A hypothetical example: Bank of America note might be valued at 90 cents on the dollar while a Bank of New Hampshire note might be valued at only 80 cents on the dollar. 


[^centralbank]: Banks do earn some interest on U.S. dollars they store at the central bank. These dollars are called reserves and they are the only real digital version of the U.S. dollar. The reserves primarily serve the purpose of facilitating transactions between different banks and allowing them to withdraw cash when in need. They also allow the central bank to influence the interest rates in the economy by controlling the interest rate on the reserves. Interestingly in some places in Europe the interest rate on reserves is negative so that banks are better off keeping their reserves in cash in vaults which carries some negative interest through storage and security costs. 


[^fdic]: Bank runs are partly solved with the government insuring deposits up to a certain amount. For example, the U.S. governement insures bank deposits up to a $250,000 (as of 2021) through a program called FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) in chequing accounts. However if you're over that limit and the bank goes bankrupt there is no guarantee that you'll get your money back. This is a fundamental difference between physical currency and a bank deposit. 

[^theoryofmoney]: The theory that all money is in fact credit is called the credit theory of money and has origins back to Plato. The proponents of this theory stipulate that all money creation is in fact a creation of credit and debt. See [The Credit Theory of Money](https://www.modernmoneynetwork.org/sites/default/files/biblio/the_credit_theory_of_money.pdf) by Alfred Mitchell-Innes.
