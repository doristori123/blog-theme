Could be titled misconceptions on banking

could add in the free banking era

I tend to hear the following statement thrown around a lot:

>Banks accept deposits and then loan them out and make a profit from the difference in interest

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of of how banking really works. There's no law that says that deposits need to be at least equal to or greater than outstanding loans. Another recent misconception is that the amount of outstanding loans are a direct multiplier of deposits (frequently referred to as the *money multiplier*). For example the following statement comes from Yuval Noah Harari's *Sapiens*:

>Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes

But as of 2020 the above statement is false for the United States.  It has joined a host of other countries such as the UK, Sweden and Canada that have all abolished the so-called **reserve requirement**. 

But can banks then just create unlimited amounts of money? The short answer is *no* but to give you the long answer we need to answer 

>Where does new *money* come from?

 Is it just created from thin air? Yes! It's called **credit** and it's much much more widespread than you'd think. 

## What is credit?

Imagine you go shopping at your neighbourhood grocery store. But when you go up to the aisle to pay for your groceries you realize you forgot your wallet at home. Let's say your groceries cost $20. The clerk, knowing you're a trustworthy person, writes on a piece of paper that you owe him $20 and you're off the hook till the next time you go to the grocery store. Poof! The clerk just created $20 dollars out of thin air. 

Let's explore why that is. You can go home and spend the $20 dollar bill that would have been used to pay for groceries however you'd like. But the clerk's slip of paper also functions as money in a sense and that's the money that was created. In theory the clerk can go to your grandma and buy cookies for $20 worth and give her the paper slip. You now owe your grandma $20 dollars. The *new* $20 worth of **money** created by this system doesn't exit the money supply (the total amount of money in a system) until you pay up the debt and tear up the paper slip. 

It follows from this little toy example that credit is inherently built on **trust**. The clerk would never have issued the paper slip if he didn't trust that at some point you would pay for your groceries. For the credit to be functionally equivalent to money it needs other people to trust it as well. 

Banks function in a very similar way as the clerk did in our example except they do it on a much larger scale and there's a widespread trust in the digital money they issue. The dollar amount in your chequing account stored on the bank's servers and ultimately displayed on your computer screen is in fact analogous (with a few caveats) to the paper slip in our grocery store example. This clears up another common misconception that *a bank deposit is equal to physical currency*.^[FDIC] In fact the vast portion of the money supply is actually credit and not actual physical currency.



## What happens when a bank creates credit?

Let's walk through an example of how credit gets created via the banking system. When a bank makes a loan it simply credits your account with the loan amount. That money didn't exist before your bank account was updated with the new amount.  Phew! That was easy!

With respect to accounting the bank now has a new asset on its balance sheet, the loan, and a liability which is the deposit in your bank account[^ironic]. 

Now let's say you buy a house for this new money. If the seller is using the same bank itÂ´s simply a matter of a few clicks on the computer and magically your account is debited and the sellers account is credited. 

However, if the seller is with a different bank gets a bit more complicated. The sellers bank needs to receive money so that it can mark up the seller's account. But sending a truck full of money to another bank whenever there is a transaction seems like a hassle. 

What banks could do is that every bank would have an account at every other bank. However, it is obvious that this system doesn't scale very well. That's where the central bank comes in, as a bank for the banks. Each bank will hold reserves at the central bank and interbank settlements will happen by moving around or lending reserves between accounts at the central bank. 


## How do we make sure banks don't create too much credit?

So in the beginning of this blog post we noted that there's no reserve requirements on banks in numerous countries including the US as of today. Then what is stopping banks from creating an infinite amount of credit? And if there isn't surely that must be bad for society?

Yes, too much credit is bad because too much money in circulation with respect to the goods and service produced in an economoy will cause inflation. So how do we prevent this from happening? 

The answer is twofold. First, banks are businesses and therefore their objective is to be profitable. The pool of borrowers that are likely to pay back their loans is limited and therefore the amount of potential profitable loans is limited as well. Banks need to make sure they stay solvent in the case that that they'll start to have net outflows to other banks draining their reserves.

Secondly, the central bank is responsible for keeping tabs on the health of the economy i.e. measuring the money supply and inflation. They impose regulation on the banks in the form of *capital requirements* which dictate how much risk a bank can carry on it's balance sheet. The central bank also has tools to affect the profitability of banks through influencing interest rates and a more heavy handed process called qunatitative easing. Diving into central bank policies is a material for another blog post but you can see that these policies ultimately dictate lending in the economy since they directly influence the profitability of the banks.

[^ironic]: It's a little bit ironic but at this time the bank owes you the loan that it credited to your account at the same time that you ultimately owe the bank back the loan. 

[^FDIC]: For example, the governement insures bank deposits up to a certain limit through a program called FDIC in chequing accounts. However if you're over that limit and the bank goes bankrupt there is no guarantee that you'll get your money back. This is a fundamental difference between physical currency and bank deposit. The only functional equivalent of physical currency are central bank reserves and they are only available to banks.
