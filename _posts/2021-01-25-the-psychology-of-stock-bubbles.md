title:  "The Psychology of Stock Bubbles"
---


The recent *800%* rally in the stock of brick-and-mortar video game store *GameStop* over the span of a couple of days, in the middle of a pandemic, seems to defy all laws of financial theory. Surely the business itself didn't suddenly grow 22 billions over 5 days. However, it is hardly the first time such bubbles have happened in individual stock issues. For example, *Qualcomm* rose a whopping *2,619%* in the middle of the dot-com bubble before cratering when the bubble popped in 2000. But what causes these bubbles to happen in the first place?

Surely there is no simple answer to this question. Talk to five different people and you will probably get five different answers. You might hear terms such as quantitive easing, asset bubble, short squeeze etc. But I'm looking for a more fundamental cause, digging under the surface for the first principles. Would this happen in a world full of perfectly economically rational robots? My answer is a strong **no** and it surely doesn't matter if these robots live on a negative interest planet. It therefore seems obvious that the answer lies somewhere in the human mind.


I found my answer in a rather unorthodox book, *Poor Charlie's Almanack*, a collection of the thoughts and speeches of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet's lifelong investment partner. Known for his wit and multidisciplinary mind the book is full of timeless wisdom not only on investing but on life in general. The talk that most interested me, *The Psychology of Human Misjudgement*, details Charlie's framework for explaining why humans make irrational decisions. The framework consists of roughly 25 psychological tendencies that distort our perception of reality. When these factors synthesize in the same direction we tend to see big effects, a so called *Loolapalooza* effect. And while some effects are positive resulting  some can be very irrational and lead to negative outcomes such as investment bubbles. 

Clearly stock bubbles are a powerful example of a Loolapalooza effect. But what are the exact psycological factors that combine and cause people to abandon reason and take part in the madness of the crowds. Let's take a look through the cold and hard objective lens of Charlie Munger:


##  1. Social Proof    

When we see others take an action our brains convinces us that this is the correct action to take. A good example of this is the bystander effect where people are less likely to assist someone in need if more people are present and not doing anything about it. Another example is how effective influencers are at marketing products. Seeing someone popular use a product increases the chance of you buying it even though it says nothing about the quality of the product.

When we see a lot of people buying a certain stock the brain becomes more susceptible to leaving rationality behind because *everybody is doing it*! 

## 2. Envy
Envy is a very powerful psychological tendency and can make intelligent rational people take very foolish decisions. Envy and jealousy are rooted deep in human nature and can have disastrous effects. Stories since the dawn of civilization are filled with examples of how envy and jealousy are a recipe for a very unhappy ending.  No wonder major religions had so much distaste for it. It's easy to see why stock bubbles would trigger this psychological tendency and compel people to join in on the fun and not get left behind when their friends, neighbours and co-workers are getting rich.     I believe that one of the root causes of envy is found in how the human mind conducts measurement. It is well known that it doesn't understand absolute values, all it knows is how to measure one thing relative to another. For example, a Yale study[^1] showed that with respect to wealth tax 50% of the public would prefer to earn less money as long as they earned as much or more than their neighbor.

## 3. Availability-Misweighing
The brain always overweighs information that is easily available to it due to it's evolutionary short-circuiting cognitive system. Super effective when running away from a lion but not so much when picking investments. In my opinion, social media and the internet in general have made this effect much stronger than in the past because of how quickly information goes viral. On top of that the distribution of stories seems to follow a power law where 10% of the stories dominate 90% of the space on social media apps and newspaper websites.    Evidently this overweighs bubble stocks that are heavily featured in the news in the investors mind. So when capital needs to choose where to be invested it misweighs what is right in front of its nose. This also creates a feedback cycle since more stock movement will cause more news which causes more buying which causes ...


## 4. Overoptimism
A healthy dose of optimism can be an advantage when dealing with the hardships faced in life. However the human brain has a tendency to overweigh the odds in its favour. The result is the existence of things such as lottery tickets and the casinos of Las Vegas. The reality is that such bets with negative expected value mean that if you play enough games you are guaranteed to lose.    In fact it would help a lot if more people thought of buying into a stock bubble like buying a lottery ticket. But the reality is that it is seldom the case. These stock market lottery tickets get mixed in with the term 'investing' and the stock price graph makes it seem like the probability of a loss is practically zero. 



## 5. Excessive Self-Regard
This tendency is probably pretty familiar to most of us. Some people might know this as the Dunning-Kruger Effect. In essence our brain tricks us into thinking we are  better than we really are of various skills. For example, Charlie cites a Swedish survey in his book where they showed that ninety percent of automobile drivers considered themselves above average.    Now let's apply this to a stock bubble. The stock is detached from its fundamentals and people only buy it on the premise that they can sell it to the next sucker for a higher price. Now considering that we've established that we humans are horrible at identifying that we might indeed be the sucker does this sound like a good idea? 


## All in all...
When numerous psychological factors like these five work in tandem  it helps shine a light on why big irrational phenomenom occur so often in the real world. But knowing the cause doesn't help in predicting when and where these bubbles start and when they finally pop. Even Sir Isaac Newton couldn't predict the the South Sea bubble where he personally lost 20000 pounds. That is a whopping 6 million  in 2020 dollars. He is credited with the famous quote 

>I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people.

and if Newton couldn't most people can't. Denial of this statement would be a prime example the *excessive self-regard* tendency. 


As a parting thought I want to express that the intent of this blog post is purely selfish in nature. I have found with the help of Charlie that a good way to really pound some knowledge into your brain is to apply what you think you have learnt to current events. That is what I have tried my best to accurately do and it is almost surely riddled with mistakes. At the very least I hope that I as well as you, the reader, have slightly decreased our chances in the future of falling victim to the tricks of our own brains.
