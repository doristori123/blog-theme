&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Banks accept deposits from savers and then loan those deposits out to borrowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how banking really works. The truth is that there’s no law that says that deposits need to be at least equal to or greater than outstanding loans. In fact, banks can loan out much more money than they have in deposits.  Which leads us to the question, &lt;em&gt;where does this extra money come from?&lt;/em&gt; Is it just created from thin air? The short answer is &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt; - it’s called &lt;strong&gt;credit&lt;/strong&gt; and it’s much more widespread than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-credit&quot;&gt;What is credit?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you go shopping at your neighbourhood grocery store. When you go up to pay for your groceries, you realize you’ve forgotten your wallet at home. Let’s say your groceries cost \$20. The clerk, knowing you’re a trustworthy person, writes on a slip of paper that you owe him \$20. You’re off the hook until the next time you visit the grocery store. Poof! The clerk just created \$20 dollars out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore why that is the case. You can now go home and spend a \$20 dollar bill that would have been used for groceries however you’d like. But the clerk’s slip of paper also functions as money, and this is precisely the money that was created. Who would have thought that grocery store clerks had the power to create money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how exactly does the slip of paper function as money? Let’s take our example a little further. It just so happens that the store clerk is a big cookie aficionado and your grandma is the best baker in town. The clerk can now visit your grandma and buy \$20 worth of cookies in exchange for the paper slip. You now owe your grandma the \$20 dollars you owed the clerk. The new \$20 worth of money created doesn’t exit the &lt;em&gt;money supply&lt;/em&gt; (the total amount of money in the economy) until you pay up the debt and tear up the slip of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this example, we can see that credit is inherently built on trust. The clerk would have never issued the paper slip if he didn’t trust that at some point in the future, you would pay for your groceries. And for the paper slip to be functionally equivalent to money, it needs other people to trust it, not just your grandma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper slip is what we call credit, which is simply &lt;em&gt;an agreement between two parties on payment for resources at a later date&lt;/em&gt;. Note that credit inherently creates &lt;strong&gt;debt&lt;/strong&gt; simoultaneously - the store clerk gets the credit but you have a debt to pay it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks function similar to the clerk in our example, except they do it on a much larger scale and there’s widespread trust in the credit they issue. In fact, most of what we normally call money in the economy is actually credit and only a tiny amount is cash, i.e. physical coins and bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tie it all together, when a bank creates a loan, it enters a new number into your bank account with just a few taps, effectively increasing the total amount of money in the world. But is there any difference between this new money and the physical dollar bill in my hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-difference-between-bank-deposits-and-cash&quot;&gt;What’s the difference between bank deposits and cash?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the terms &lt;em&gt;credit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cash&lt;/em&gt; is blurry. In everyday life, bank deposits (credit) are treated as cash, and we refer to both as money. However, another common misconception is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bank deposits are synonymous with cash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption that these two terms are &lt;em&gt;perfectly equivalent&lt;/em&gt; is erroneous, and although it is generally true this assumption breaks down under extreme conditions. Let’s explore what these conditions are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A helpful trick is to think about bank deposits as being denominated in different currencies that are pegged to a national currency, such as the U.S. dollar, one-to-one.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:banktrust&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:banktrust&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Let’s say that you are a customer of Bank of America (BAC). When you go to the ATM to withdraw cash, what you’re really saying is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m going to exchange x BAC dollars for x U.S. dollars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And voilà, you’ve now converted BAC dollars from the chequing account stored on a computer server to physical U.S. dollars. This seems like a lot of mental gymnastics but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/bank_note.png&quot; alt=&quot;A bank note issued by the Bank of North Carolina in 1859. This bank note is somewhat analogous to an online bank deposit today.&quot; style=&quot;max-width:70%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; display: inline; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A bank note issued by the Bank of North Carolina in 1859. This bank note is somewhat analogous to an online bank deposit today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you went to the ATM to withdraw cash, the Bank of America had to find those U.S. dollars to give to you. Remember, &lt;em&gt;credit is a promise for a payment in the future&lt;/em&gt;. When you originally deposited U.S. dollars into your chequing account, credit was created with a promise to pay you back your original U.S. dollars in the future. The credit was the BAC dollar amount displayed in your bank account. However this didn’t create new money since Bank of America still had your U.S. dollars in its vault. Meanwhile, Bank of America is free to &lt;strong&gt;create&lt;/strong&gt; new money by making loans to borrowers. Creating loans means issuing more BAC dollars as bank deposits. And the bank deposits can quickly grow much larger than the cash in the bank’s vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, back to our question. Under what conditions does the assumption that &lt;em&gt;bank deposits equal cash&lt;/em&gt; break?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when &lt;em&gt;Bank of America doesn’t have enough U.S. dollar bills when the time comes for your ATM withdrawal?&lt;/em&gt; It must sell some of its assets, like stocks, for U.S. dollars. If the bank doesn’t have enough assets, or the assets turn out to be very hard to sell, the bank runs the risk of defaulting on its obligations to you and becoming &lt;em&gt;insolvent&lt;/em&gt;. And you might not get all of the U.S. dollars you deposited back from the bankruptcy process; for every BAC dollar you might only get 50 U.S. cents. This risk is one of the reasons &lt;em&gt;banks cannot create an infinite amount of money&lt;/em&gt;. When a bank defaults, it violates our one-to-one assumption of BAC dollars to U.S. dollars and we can see why cash and bank deposits are not perfectly equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time the bank is forced to convert its own currency to U.S. dollars it has to find those U.S. dollars somewhere. This can happen when people transfer money to a different bank or make a cash withdrawal: anything that takes money out of the world of that bank. Keeping this much cash on hand is costly since it doesn’t earn interest&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:centralbank&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:centralbank&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so banks invest in long term assets such as stocks and bonds. The bank doesn’t want to be forced to sell those assets at an unfortunate time. In fact, massive selling could cause the value of those assets to plummet even further. This is why banks come up with ATM withdrawal limits, withdrawal fees and accounts with less flexibility to withdraw, like savings accounts. It’s all done to incentivize customers to refrain from forcing the bank to convert its made-up currency into the national one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insolvencies used to happen very frequently in the past and they are a long way from being extinct. A recent example is the British bank &lt;em&gt;Northern Rock&lt;/em&gt; in 2009. The bank defaulted during the financial crisis and a lot of people lost most of their deposits. When people sense that a bank is at a risk of becoming insolvent, they will rush to withdraw their deposits. This is frequently referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;bank run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fdic&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fdic&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The psychological herd mentality fuelling bank runs ironically increases the chances of the bank becoming insolvent. The bank might not be able to sell its assets for a good enough price all at once so the crowd’s fear of insolvency becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a common misconception that banks loan out cash that has been deposited. A bank can, in fact, create money out of nothing via loans and it’s called &lt;em&gt;credit&lt;/em&gt;. This works because bank deposits function as the bank’s own currency. If the bank issues too much of this currency it runs the risk of becoming insolvent. This often results in a bank run and the illusion that bank deposits are equal to cash is lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When banks issue too much credit it is often referred to as a credit bubble. A credit bubble behaves in a lot of similar ways as stock bubbles (see my earlier blog &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021/01/28/the-psychology-of-stock-bubbles/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;). Few people know it’s a bubble until it bursts. The stock and credit markets are systems controlled by the whims of humans and are therefore bound by the laws of psychology. It follows that we shouldn’t be surprised that they exhibit the same imperfections as human nature with all its heighs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:banktrust&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the past this was exactly how banks issued credit. They printed their own bank notes, e.g. a Bank of America bill. This had a lot of problems including the bank notes with the same face value being valued differently depending on the risk of a particular bank defaulting. A hypothetical example: Bank of America note might be valued at 90 cents on the dollar while a Bank of New Hampshire note might be valued at only 80 cents on the dollar. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:banktrust&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:centralbank&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Banks do earn some interest on U.S. dollars they store at the central bank. These dollars are called reserves and they are the only real digital version of the U.S. dollar. The reserves primarily serve the purpose of facilitating transactions between different banks and allowing them to withdraw cash when in need. They also allow the central bank to influence the interest rates in the economy by controlling the interest rate on the reserves. Interestingly in some places in Europe the interest rate on reserves is negative so that banks are better off keeping their reserves in cash in vaults which carries some negative interest through storage and security costs. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:centralbank&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fdic&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bank runs are partly solved with the government insuring deposits up to a certain amount. For example, the U.S. governement insures bank deposits up to a \$250,000 (as of 2021) through a program called FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) in chequing accounts. However if you’re over that limit and the bank goes bankrupt there is no guarantee that you’ll get your money back. This is a fundamental difference between physical currency and a bank deposit. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fdic&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Surely new information didn’t come forward so that the value of the business could suddenly grow 22 billions in just over 5 days. However, it is hardly the first time such bubbles have happened in individual stock issues. For example, &lt;em&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/em&gt; rose a whopping &lt;em&gt;2,619%&lt;/em&gt; in the middle of the dot-com bubble before cratering when the bubble popped in 2000. And keep in mind that bubbles have been occurring long before the advent of technology and globalization. Back in the 18th century the &lt;em&gt;Mississippi Company&lt;/em&gt;, a French trading company, rose &lt;em&gt;3,000%&lt;/em&gt; before losing more than &lt;em&gt;50%&lt;/em&gt; of its value the next year&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:missisippi&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:missisippi&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But what causes these bubbles to happen in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; display: inline; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;GME stock price over the last 6 months.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no simple answer to this question. Ask five different people and you will probably get five different answers. You might hear terms such as quantitative easing, asset bubble, short squeeze etc. A lot of articles have been written on these topics with respect to speculative bubbles. But I was more interested in the fundamental cause that allows bubbles to appear in general. I wanted to understand the reason for their existence, using first principles thinking. Would bubbles happen in a world full of perfectly economically rational robots? My answer was a resounding &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; and it surely doesn’t matter if these robots live on a negative interest planet. It therefore seemed obvious that the answer lies hidden in the inner workings of the human mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found my answer in a rather unorthodox book, &lt;em&gt;Poor Charlie’s Almanack&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of the thoughts and speeches of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet’s lifelong investment partner. Known for his wit and multidisciplinary mind, the book is full of timeless wisdom not only on investing but on life in general. The talk that most interested me, &lt;em&gt;The Psychology of Human Misjudgement&lt;/em&gt;, details Charlie’s framework for explaining why humans make irrational decisions. The framework consists of roughly &lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; psychological tendencies that distort our perception of reality. When these factors synthesize in the same direction we tend to see large effects, a so-called &lt;em&gt;Lollapalooza&lt;/em&gt; effect. And while some of these large effects can arguably be positive like the market dominance of brands such as &lt;em&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/em&gt;, other effects can be very irrational and lead to negative outcomes such as indoctrinating people into cults.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose stock bubbles are an example of a &lt;em&gt;Lollapalooza&lt;/em&gt; effect. What are the exact psychological factors that combine and cause people to abandon reason and take part in the madness of the crowds. Let’s take a look through the cold and hard objective lens of Charlie Munger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-social-proof--&quot;&gt;1. Social Proof    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see others take an action our brain convinces us that this is the correct action to take. A good example of this is the &lt;strong&gt;bystander effect&lt;/strong&gt; where people are less likely to assist someone in need if more people are present and not doing anything about it. Another example is how effective social media influencers are at marketing products. Seeing someone popular use a product increases the chance of you buying it even though it says absolutely nothing about the quality of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see a lot of people buying a certain stock the brain becomes more susceptible to leaving rationality behind because &lt;em&gt;everybody is doing it&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore it must be the right thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-envy&quot;&gt;2. Envy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy is a very powerful psychological tendency and can make intelligent rational people make very foolish decisions. Envy and jealousy are deeply rooted in human nature and can have disastrous effects. Stories since the dawn of civilization are filled with examples of how envy and jealousy are a recipe for a very unhappy ending. No wonder major religions had so much distaste for it. We have evidence of written laws from as early as early as the second millenium BC attempting to prevent the negative societal impacts of envy. The Code of Hammurabi, a code of 128 laws from ancient Mesopotamia inscribed on a stone pillar includes the following law: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that one of the root causes of envy is found in how the human mind conducts measurement. It is well known that it doesn’t understand absolute values, all it knows is how to measure one thing relative to another. For example, a Yale study&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:income&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:income&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed that when asked about wealth tax &lt;em&gt;50% of the public would prefer to earn less money as long as they earned as much or more than their neighbour&lt;/em&gt;. With that in mind it’s easy to see how stock bubbles trigger this psychological tendency and compel people to join in on the fun and not get left behind when their friends, neighbours and co-workers are getting rich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; display: inline; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Code of Hammurabi. Currently at the Louvre.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-availability-misweighing&quot;&gt;3. Availability-Misweighing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain always overweighs information that is easily available to it due to its evolutionary short-circuiting cognitive system. Back in prehistoric times this gave man an advantage when fleeing predators but I’m afraid it has the opposite effect on his stock picking abilities. In my opinion, social media and the internet in general have made this effect much stronger than in the past because of how information goes viral. The distribution of media seems to follow a power law where 10% of the content dominates 90% of the space on online media.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently this overweighs bubble stocks that are heavily featured in the news. So when investors need to choose where to deploy their capital they mostly look at what is right in front of their eyes. This also creates a vicious feedback cycle since more stock movement will cause more headlines which causes more buying which causes …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-overoptimism&quot;&gt;4. Overoptimism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy dose of optimism can be an advantage when dealing with the hardships faced in life. However, the human brain has a tendency to overweigh the odds that are in its favour. The result is the existence of things such as lottery tickets and the colorful casinos of Las Vegas. The reality is that such bets have a negative expected value. This means that if you play enough games you are guaranteed to lose money.  The house always wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock bubbles have an intrinsic misleading marketing material that reinforces this overoptimism tendency. Buying into stock bubbles gets mixed in with the term ‘investing’ and the stock price graph makes it seem like the probability of a loss is practically zero.And since the perceived risk is so low people are willing to put in more capital. Ironically, it would help if people thought about buying into a stock bubble like buying a lottery ticket. It would set expectations right. Many people lose a significant amount of their savings in a stock bubble but I haven’t heard of anyone going broke from buying lottery tickets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-excessive-self-regard&quot;&gt;5. Excessive Self-Regard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency is probably pretty familiar to most of us. Some people might know this as the Dunning-Kruger Effect. In essence, our brain tricks us into thinking we are better than we really are at various skills. For example, Charlie cites a Swedish survey in his book where they showed that &lt;strong&gt;90%&lt;/strong&gt; percent of automobile drivers considered themselves above average.
Now let’s apply this to a stock bubble. The stock is detached from its fundamentals and people only buy it on the premise that they can sell it to the next sucker for a higher price. And so on and so forth. Now considering that we’ve established that us humans are horrible at identifying that we might indeed be the sucker in question does this sound like a good idea? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-in-all&quot;&gt;All in all…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When numerous psychological factors like these five work in tandem it helps shine a light on why large irrational phenomenon occur so often in the real world. But knowing the cause doesn’t help in predicting &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;where&lt;/strong&gt; these bubbles start nor when they finally pop. Even Sir Isaac Newton couldn’t predict when the &lt;em&gt;South Sea Company&lt;/em&gt; bubble popped and he ended up losing 20.000 pounds. That’s a little under &lt;strong&gt;6 million&lt;/strong&gt; in 2020 dollars to put that amount into perspective. After losing his savings Newton is credited to have said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if Newton couldn’t it is very likely that you and I can’t. Denial of this statement would be a prime example of the &lt;em&gt;excessive self-regard&lt;/em&gt; tendency. Remember that the only person that reliably makes money in bubbles is your broker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a parting thought I want to express that the intent of this blog post is purely selfish in nature. I have found with the help of Charlie that a good way to really pound some knowledge into your brain is to apply what you think you have learnt to current events. That is what I have tried my best to accurately do and it is almost surely riddled with mistakes. At the very least I hope that I, as well as you the reader, have slightly decreased our chances in the future of falling victim to the tricks of our own brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The recent 800% rally in the stock of brick-and-mortar video game store GameStop over the span of a couple of days, in the middle of a pandemic, seems to defy all laws of financial theory. Surely new information didn’t come forward so that the value of the business could suddenly grow 22 billions in just over 5 days. However, it is hardly the first time such bubbles have happened in individual stock issues. For example, Qualcomm rose a whopping 2,619% in the middle of the dot-com bubble before cratering when the bubble popped in 2000. And keep in mind that bubbles have been occurring long before the advent of technology and globalization. Back in the 18th century the Mississippi Company, a French trading company, rose 3,000% before losing more than 50% of its value the next year1. But what causes these bubbles to happen in the first place?  The Mississippi Bubble, or How the French Eliminated All Their Government Debt (So Why Can’t Bernanke?), 2013 &amp;#8617;</summary></entry></feed>
